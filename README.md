# Music Classifier Machine Learning

## Description
This repository contains a comprehensive project focused on music classification using machine learning. The project involves various stages including data preprocessing, label creation, model training, and evaluation. It leverages a dataset of normalized songs to predict music categories.

## Key Features
- **Preprocessing**: Scripts for cleaning and preparing music data.
- **Label Creation**: Scripts to create and assign labels based on song features.
- **Model Training**: Implements a machine learning pipeline to train models on the dataset.
- **Evaluation**: Scripts to evaluate the performance of trained models and generate reports.
